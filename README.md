#What Skills!

##The Problem
Understanding people and skills becomes an unjust and impossible task within large organizations. 
  - How can you survey the strenth of skills within the business? 
  - How do you identify the right individual with the right skills? 
  - How can you even trust those skills when I find that person? 

##The Solution
Enable accountability and transparency of skills across distributed networks of people through a commodized system of encorsements. Build user profiles and give eachother "daps" (or votes) towards specific skills. Endorsements are precious and limited in supply (default set to '3') so choose carefully; the point is to brush off all the noise and nepotism to create a trusted network of skills. 

##Usage
Create a user profile and build whatever skill you think you have. Provide accoldates to others who you think are the beez kneez. Feel free to provide comments as well if you need to contextualize any of your thoughts. 

##Implementation 
Local deployment is easy: 

```
git clone https://github.com/Tkwon123/whatskills/
bundle install
rails s 
```
